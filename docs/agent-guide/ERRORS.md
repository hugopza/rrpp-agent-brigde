# Error Register

Record mistakes that can recur or reveal a weakness in the development process. This is not an incident log and MUST NOT contain secrets, personal data, or raw customer content.

## Entry Format

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD - Short title

- Context: where the mistake occurred.
- Error: what went wrong.
- Cause: why it happened.
- Correction: how it was fixed or contained.
- Prevention: a concrete rule or automated check that prevents recurrence.
```

## Entries

### 2026-06-19 - Sandbox-inaccessible smoke-test path

- Context: CLI smoke testing used an absolute temporary database path.
- Error: SQLite could not open the database inside the managed execution environment.
- Cause: The chosen host path was outside the command sandbox's writable view.
- Correction: The smoke test was repeated with the ignored `var/` directory inside the workspace.
- Prevention: Use repository-local ignored paths for runtime smoke tests unless external-path access has already been verified.

### 2026-06-19 - Oversized patch used fragile context

- Context: A combined patch attempted to add observability, replace the CLI, and modify many dashboard sections.
- Error: The complete patch was rejected because one CSS context line did not match exactly.
- Cause: Too many independent edits depended on a single large context-sensitive patch.
- Correction: The changes were split by subsystem and the dashboard was replaced as one explicit file operation.
- Prevention: Split cross-file changes into independently verifiable patches; replace a file deliberately when most of its structure changes.

### 2026-06-19 - Tests lagged behind a positional API change

- Context: `process_one` changed from receiving a mode argument to reading durable runtime mode.
- Error: Existing tests passed `shadow` and `dry-run` as the positional worker ID and did not initialize runtime mode.
- Cause: The public helper and its tests were not changed atomically.
- Correction: Tests now initialize durable mode and invoke the new keyword-oriented contract.
- Prevention: When changing a callable signature, search all call sites and update implementation plus tests in the same patch; prefer keyword arguments for operational parameters.

### 2026-06-19 - Tests assumed unstable timestamp ordering

- Context: Retry and mode-matrix tests selected rows using timestamps created within the same millisecond and inserted a timestamp with different precision.
- Error: Tests selected the wrong row or treated an intended past time as later during lexical comparison.
- Cause: Operational identity was inferred from timestamp order instead of stable identifiers, and timestamp formats were mixed.
- Correction: Assertions join through message IDs; forced timestamps use the same fixed-width UTC format as production values.
- Prevention: Use IDs for correlation and ordering; use the project UTC helper or a clearly old fixed-width timestamp in tests.

### 2026-06-19 - Initial migration backup ignored SQLite WAL

- Context: The first migration implementation backed up the database with a filesystem copy.
- Error: A direct copy can omit committed pages still present in the WAL file; migration version checks also happened before taking the write lock.
- Cause: SQLite was treated as a single inert file instead of an active transactional database.
- Correction: Backups use SQLite's online backup API, and migration versions are rechecked while holding `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`.
- Prevention: Use database-native backup and transactional migration primitives; never copy a live SQLite main file as the only backup.

### 2026-06-19 - Local setup assumed newer PowerShell cryptography and UTF-8 behavior

- Context: Automated creation of local secrets and `.env` on Windows PowerShell.
- Error: The shell lacked the static `RandomNumberGenerator.Fill` method, and `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` added a BOM that invalidated the first environment key.
- Cause: The setup command assumed newer .NET and PowerShell encoding semantics than the user's installed shell provides.
- Correction: Secret generation uses an instantiated random-number generator with `GetBytes`; the file is written with BOM-less `UTF8Encoding`, while the application accepts UTF-8 with or without BOM.
- Prevention: Use Windows PowerShell 5.1-compatible APIs for setup scripts and explicitly control BOM behavior for machine-readable files.

### 2026-06-19 - Packaging configuration omitted the build backend

- Context: Installing the project editable and building the first wheel.
- Error: `pip` fell back to setuptools, whose flat-layout discovery treated `var/` as another top-level package.
- Cause: Hatch-specific build configuration existed, but `pyproject.toml` did not declare Hatchling in `[build-system]`.
- Correction: The manifest now declares `hatchling.build`, explicitly packages `rrpp_bridge`, includes migration SQL, and ignores build artifacts.
- Prevention: A packaging change is incomplete until editable installation and wheel/sdist builds succeed from a workspace containing ignored runtime directories.

### 2026-06-19 - Editable install excluded its build helper

- Context: Retrying editable installation after installing Hatchling locally.
- Error: `pip install --no-build-isolation -e .` could not import the `editables` helper.
- Cause: Disabling build isolation also bypassed discovery and installation of an editable-only build requirement.
- Correction: Install the helper in the project virtual environment, then verify both editable installation and the generated CLI entry point.
- Prevention: Use normal build isolation for editable installs unless every dynamic build requirement has been explicitly provisioned and verified.
