# Architecture Decision Log

This file indexes architectural decisions. A high-impact decision MUST be documented before implementation. Proposed decisions do not override confirmed requirements or accepted decisions.

## Statuses

- `Proposed`: recommended and awaiting approval or implementation evidence.
- `Accepted`: approved or deliberately established by implementation.
- `Superseded`: replaced by a later ADR, with a link to its replacement.
- `Rejected`: considered and intentionally not selected.

## Decision Index

| ID | Decision | Status | Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ADR-0001 | Use a persistent agent guide as repository context | Accepted | 2026-06-19 |
| ADR-0002 | Select the V1 application stack | Accepted | 2026-06-19 |

## ADR-0001: Persistent Agent Guide

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-06-19
- Context: The project needs durable context that agents and humans consult before changing a security-sensitive bridge.
- Decision: Keep an English guide in `docs/agent-guide/`, with `AGENTS.md` as its mandatory entry point and the precedence defined in `README.md`.
- Consequences: Changes that affect architecture, constraints, decisions, workflow, or verified reusable knowledge must update their owning guide document.

## ADR-0002: V1 Application Stack

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-06-19
- Context: The repository has no existing stack. V1 needs a Windows-friendly local environment, durable storage and jobs, an authenticated dashboard, tests, and later VPS deployment.
- Decision: Use Python 3.12 and its standard library for V1. Use a server-rendered WSGI dashboard, SQLite with explicit transactional job claiming, environment-based configuration, signed cookie sessions, `unittest`, and separate CLI commands for the web process and worker. Deploy both processes on a single VPS with the database on a persistent volume. Introduce third-party web or queue infrastructure only when measured requirements justify it.
- Alternatives: FastAPI and SQLAlchemy would provide a richer ecosystem but add dependencies before the bridge contracts are stable. PostgreSQL plus a distributed queue improves horizontal scale but is unnecessary for a single-owner V1.
- Consequences: Local setup is dependency-free and Windows-friendly. The application is intentionally single-host; SQLite and the WSGI server must be replaced before horizontal scaling. Schema migrations are ordered SQL files applied by the application.
- Validation: Unit and integration tests cover ingestion, idempotency, processing, policy, retry handling, authentication, and dashboard access.

## ADR Template

```markdown
## ADR-NNNN: Decision title

- Status: Proposed
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Context: Why a decision is needed and which constraints apply.
- Decision: The selected approach and its behavioral boundaries.
- Alternatives: Meaningful options considered and why they were not selected.
- Consequences: Operational, security, compatibility, and maintenance effects.
- Validation: Tests or evidence that demonstrate the decision works.
- Supersedes: ADR-NNNN, when applicable.
